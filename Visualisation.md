# html, defaults to velocity templates #
The default mechanism to display information to the participant is in html, transformed with the velocity template engine. The velocity template engine uses a very simple mark-up and allows for quick learning. They key syntax is that variables can be called by preceding a dollar sign, thus _$number_ will display the variable number if present.

Participants enter their information into html form elements. All forms of inputs that are allowed in html can be used.

Key elements are:
  * 
  * 
  * 

### Error Handling ###
The validation step in the **FLOW** of the expereiment (above) creates an error element that can be used to display appropriate error messages to the participants.
