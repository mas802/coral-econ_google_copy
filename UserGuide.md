# Introduction #

CORAL is a lightweight framework to organise computer based sequential interactive experiments based on Java. It features a Java backend to control the flow of the experiment and a Java and iOS Client. It follows a seperation of flow, visualisation and logic. This allows for automated testing and a high level of flexibility.
